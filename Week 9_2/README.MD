# Week 9

**Task 1** 
Use a weather forecast website, and utilize the psychrometric chart and the formula we went through in the class to determine the absoloute humidity, the wet-bulb temperature and the mass of water vapour in the air in ClassRoom A (Aula A) of Piacenza campus in the moment that you are solving this exercise (provide the inputs that you utilized)



[Weather Forecast Website example](https://www.meteo-oggi.it/italia/regione-emilia-romagna/tempo-piacenza/)

Umidit√†: Relative humidity, Pressione atmosferica: Air total pressure (1 hPa: 0.1 kPa), Temperatura effettiva: temperature to be utilized.
