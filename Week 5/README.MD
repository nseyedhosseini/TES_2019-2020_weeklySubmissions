#Week 5 



**Task 1**
In you own words (which means in your own words)  write a summary of the topics about radiative heat transfer we went through including the definitions of emissivity, absorptivity and reflectivity, the view factor, the heat exchange betweeen two black surfaces,the heat exchange between the two gray surface and finally the definition of radiative resistances

**Task 2**
Solve the last example you solved in the class (radiative heat exchange between two parallel plates) awhile considering the two emissivities to be 0.1, what can you conclude from the result?
