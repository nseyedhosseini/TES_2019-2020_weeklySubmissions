## How to upload your weekly submission 

### Step 1: uploading the file into your forked respository 

Fork this repository, then go to your own profile --> repositories and find the repository with the same name (this is your forked version of the repository)

you should then go to the folder of the week for which you would like to send your submission (e.g. Week 1). then click on upload file and upload the corresponding submission's PDF file.


**File Format:** .PDF is The only acceptable file format for submissions

**File Name:** The file should be called week1_nameInitial+surname.pdf:  e.g. Marco Rossi: week1_MRossi.pdf


### Step 2: submitting the file 

Once you did the previous steps, you should find the file in your own repository, though it has not  been submitted yet. You should now go to pull requests (the third tab) -->  new pull request --> create pull request --> commit   (here you can also write a message about your submission in case there is any particular detail you would like to add ) 

**Note** Please pay attention that once you send your file via pull request, you will still not see your file in this repository, this is due to the fact that I should accept your pull request.
